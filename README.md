# Terminal Snake (C)

A simple Snake game implemented in C for the terminal.

This project focuses on core game logic such as real-time input handling, a fixed-timestep game loop, snake movement, and collision detection, without using external libraries or graphics frameworks.

## Goals

* Practice real-time keyboard input in a terminal
* Implement a basic game loop in C
* Manage state updates and collisions deterministically
* Keep the code small and readable

## Scope

* Terminal-based rendering
* Keyboard-controlled movement
* Wall and self-collision detection
* Food spawning and snake growth

This project is intended as a learning exercise rather than a fully featured game.

## Build and Run

Compile with a standard C compiler (platform-specific input handling may apply).
